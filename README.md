# üìù Notes

## File extensions on imports

This project is created to be used with Deno, that's why all imports must include the file extension.

```ts
import { Screen } from './Screen'; // ES6 regular import
import { Screen } from './Screen.ts'; // Import using Deno
```

Visit https://deno.land/manual/examples/import_export for further information.
